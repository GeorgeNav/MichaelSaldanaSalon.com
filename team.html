                <p class="profile-bio">Not so Brief History - My career as a stylist began in 1991 at the age of 17.
                    Within months, I broke a national chain record at my first gig in the industry. I opened my first salon at age 21 and never looked back. I have experienced advanced education with Sebastian, Aveda, Rusk , Toni & Guy Nioxin, American crew and many international brands. The tables turned and I spent a few years as a Wella National Color Educator. Mastering color and highlights have proved useful in consultation. Whether it's softer, warm hues in your future or a burst of honey blonde highlights, I've got you covered. As I specialize in the correction of 'Oops Color Jobs,' brassy, off tones can carefully be corrected . I use artistic cuts to accentuate features, i.e.- Cheek bones, eyes, etc. If all you need is that perfect snip, no problem. Edgy styles are done with ease using razor cutting techniques, texturizing and advanced tools to accommodate all textures and stylyes . If humidity and frizz has your number, we have the option of The Keratin Smoothing Complex. A life
                    changing treatment, it will change your life as far as your everyday styling. Want to add some length and volume, Hair Extensions will give you that cover look you’ve been longing for. Hang with me for a few hours and you will leave with fuller longer hair you won’t be able to keep your hands out of. Men can feel at ease as I was American Crew's # 1 Stylist in the Nation in 2008 specializing in getting that classic taper to moldable texture looks men truly will be able to Rock!
                    Inspiration - The array of textiles we see everyday from nature to cool art! I enjoy all of my clients need of change! Whether you are looking for a stylist that can give you a consistent look or adding a new fringe or a highlight around the face for some sexy flare.</p>
